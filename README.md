## Instructions and Navigations
All of the project files are organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get(“/”)
async def root():
 return {“message”: “Hello FastAPI”}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

If you need to develop web applications quickly, where do you turn? Enter the FARM stack. The FARM stack combines the power of the Python ecosystem with REST and MongoDB and makes building web applications easy and fast.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/18OWu).
